# Beagle Bros Visualizations (Standard + Advanced)

A single-file HTML playground for math/physics visualizations.  
- **Standard mode:** 2×2 grid, 64-piece library (Lissajous, roses, spirographs, harmonographs, spirals).  
- **Advanced mode:** full-screen single canvas with heavy hitters: **SDF ray marcher**, **Mandelbulb ray-march**, **O(N²) N‑body** with trails, and **Joukowski airfoil streamlines**.

## Quick start
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build, no deps.

## Features
- Origin centered in every canvas (optional Y↑).
- Shuffle, per-pane lock (standard), contextual hover popups.
- Advanced mode swaps to a single large canvas and shuffles only within the advanced library.
